Host discovery is a technique used to discover live hosts on the network. In this article you will find different techniques and ways to perform a host discovery and evasion of security systems and different tools as well as the development of scripts to automate it.

###  HOST DISCOVERY (ICMP)

This type of Host discovery makes use of sending icmp-type packets to a network segment, since this technique can be done with tools such as nmap or nping or the same ping command

### ICMP HOST DISCOVERY WITH PING

For this first way of performing the host discovery we will create a bash script to send the icmp packets to the entire network segment and through the response determine if the host is alive.

``` bash  
#!/usr/bin/env bash

trap ctrl_c  INT  

function ctrl_c(){

  echo -ne  "\n\nExiting..\n"
  tput cnorm ;  exit  1 
}

function enumeration(){
  for  i  in $(seq  70  250);do  
    ping -c1  192.168.1.${i}  > /dev/null 2>&1
    if [[ "$(echo  $?)" == "0"  ]];then  
      echo  -ne "\n\nHost:  192.168.1.${i}\n"
    else
      :
    fi
  done
}

enumeration

```

### ICMP HOST DISCOVERY  WITH NMAP  

The well-known nmap port scanner has within its parameters one that allows the enumeration of active hosts in the network, sending only icmp type packets.

``` shell
Examples:

1 - nmap -sn 192.168.1.1-254  -T5  |  grep  -oP  "\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}" | sort  |  uniq -u

2 - nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24   -T5  |  grep  -oP  "\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}" | sort  |  uniq -u

3 - nmap -iL targets.txt

4 - nmap -iR 100 

```


### ICMP HOST DISCOVERY  WITH NPING 

The ping tool is a package that the nmap tool has when you install it, it is a scanner that allows you to create modified packages


``` shell

1 - nping -c 5 192.168.1.1-254

2 - nping --tcp -c 5 -p 80 192.168.1.0/24 --icmp

3 - nping --udp -c 5 -p 53 192.168.1.1/24 --icmp
```
